# NMaze
This project is a great example of how disjoint set forrest data structue works. This program creates a maze of N cells. This program also assures that every maze has a beggining to an end and that every maze is different from each other, since it is created at runtime.

This is an example when N=10




This is an example when N=50



This is an example when N=100


Cool huh?? 


For future fun you can try to find the path from the beggining to an end  or maybe implement some AI algorithms to make the computer find the path.
